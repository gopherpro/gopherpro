# Who is GopherPro?

I'm a fan of [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

When I'm publishing stuff, then you will find them on [SimpleGopher](https://github.com/simplegopher).

:wrench: I am currently working on [DockOps](https://github.com/dockops) (still in development).

Yeah, that's it. Bye
